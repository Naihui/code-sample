1.  How to run this java project:
	Import existing project into eclipse or other software.
	Open folder scr, then open folder himalia and then run Main.java.
	Since the server is shut down, so there would be two signs showed in the console:
unable to connect to broker on localhost
unable to connect to broker on gheineman.cs.wpi.edu
but you can still see the GUI and play with it, it just can not publish and release poem.
